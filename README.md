# World_Weather_Analysis


## PlanMyTrip App

This projectâ€™s main purpose was to create an app for clients to find ideal hotels based on their weather preferences. This used data collected from cities around the globe. The analysis was broken up into three parts of collecting the data, exploring it with visualizations, and finally visualizing the actual travel data to create the app.


## World Weather Analysis Deliverables

Once the app was created, it was sent to beta testers who recommended changes to flesh out the app further.
Weather descriptions were added, and input fields created to filter the data by the temperature preferences of the end user. This would create a filtered list of possible travel destinations in the form of hotels on a "Travel Destination" map. The end user could then select four cities to create a travel itinerary. This itinerary would then be put through the Google Maps API to create a travel itinerary map for the end user with a visual travel route between their chosen cities.
